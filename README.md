## 🌐 Overview

- Enables parents to post questions and counselors to respond
- Provides secure, role-based access for different types of users
- Integrates voice-based features and email services
- Built with a modular, scalable architecture and modern design patterns

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [SQL Server + SSMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms)
- **Azure Speech Services** key (for Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text support)
- **Mail server credentials** (for SMTP email)

### 2. Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/efchbd1013/education-for-all-backend.git
    cd education-for-all-backend
    ```

2. Set up your database connection in `appsettings.json`:
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=EducationDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
    }
    ```

3. Configure your secrets (in `appsettings.json` or user-secrets):
    - **JWT secret**
    - **SMTP credentials**
    - **Azure Speech key**

4. Apply migrations and run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    dotnet run
    ```
    
The API should now be running on the port displayed in the console output.

### 3. `appsettings.json` (Structure Example)
**Note**: This is a template example of how the `appsettings.json` file should be structured. Be sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual sensitive information, such as API keys, SMTP credentials, and JWT secrets.
